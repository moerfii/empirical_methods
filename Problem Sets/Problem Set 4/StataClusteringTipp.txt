Hence, clustering/robustifying standard errors with -xtreg- is not manadtory: it makes sense if you suspect heteroskedasticity/autocorrelation in your data (by the way, the latter is quite immaterial as long as you're dealing with a large N, small T panel dataset, as it frequently appears to be the case on this forum); otherwise, default standard errors are enough..
